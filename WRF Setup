Currently I am working on the various climate models to understand how urban green space relate to urban climates. I am using one of the mesoscale models, which is WRF. Here, I provide a useful link that I used to setup my model on Ubuntu LTS 16.04. This page gives a detail yet simple step by step procedure in installing WRF and WPS. The tutorial was written for WRF 3.8 but It can be used for the new WRF 3.9.

We need to have libnetcdf-dev

I also refer to official website of WRF to setup the model
